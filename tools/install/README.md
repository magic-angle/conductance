#### share/manifest.json

The manifest for the latest version of conductance.

To make a new release, increment the toplevel `version`,
plus the versions / URLs for any updated components.

Don't update the toplevel `format` field, that's for
incompatible changes to the self-update script (to stop
old clients trying to interpret a manifest file they
can't handle). Notes about the format history are in
./share/self-update.js

manifest-v{1,2}.json are both generated from this. They are
actually identical (except for the `format` field), but are
separated in the event we need to present a different manifest
to different client versions. For reference, v2 of the self-updater
first appeared in 0.4 (the first windows release), March 2014.

# Binary dependencies

Prebuilt binary dependencies for each platform are generated by
../package-deps (build.sjs)
This takes the current nodejs version from manifest.json, and builds
archives of portable and arch-specific deps using ZeroInstall.

Once a new set of binary dependencies are built, copy it into a new numbered
directory of https://github.com/onilabs/conductance-deps, push it, and then
update the URLs in manifest.json.

# Testing:

To run the acceptance tests for the installer, you need to have an
SSH-accessible host (real or VM) for each platform. See
./test/hosts.sjs to add your own hosts. If you haven't defined a
host for a given platform, tests for that platform will be skipped.

The only requirements for each platform are:

 - ZeroInstall
 - SSH server with passwordless SSH setup for your test user
